# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

The modified code improves readability by simplifying the logic and using more concise syntax. In the original code, there are multiple nested if statements and the variable name "candidate" may not clearly convey its purpose. The modified code introduces a single if statement using the optional chaining operator (?.) to assign the partition key from the event object or calculate it using the getHex function and JSON.stringify. The variable name "partitionKey" is more intuitive and easier to understand. The modified code also eliminates unnecessary checks by directly assigning the TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY and handles the length check in a straightforward manner. Overall, the modifications make the code more concise, readable, and easier to follow.
